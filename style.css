★ MY AWAKENING ★

I didn’t plan any of it.  
One night when I was eighteen, I took something my friends called “sassafras,” and I believed them. I thought it was just a plant, something natural. But when it hit—fast, like lightning—I realized I was stepping into something I had never touched before.  

Looking back, I now know it probably **wasn’t real sassafras** at all. What I experienced aligns much more with **MDMA or MDA**, psychoactive empathogens that mimic the empathic, tactile, and visual effects I felt. These substances act primarily by releasing serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which explains the intense emotional resonance, synesthesia-like visuals, and deep feeling of connectedness I had.  

The table started breathing.  
Textures moved like the world was made of soft waves.  
The room felt alive in a way I didn’t have words for.  

I wasn’t spiritual yet.  
I didn’t know meditation, ego death, chakras, none of it.  
I didn’t even know what “awakening” meant.  

But in that moment—sitting there with strange EDM vibrating through the walls—my mind stretched wider than it had ever stretched. I felt connected to everything, like I could sense the emotional ripple of people in the room. Like their thoughts had weight. Like their moods brushed against my skin.  

I didn’t have a name for it then.  
I just knew something inside me opened.  

And then came the breakup.  
Hard.  
Sudden.  
Like someone knocked the last support beam out from under me.  

That night, I cried until something broke loose in my chest. Not a spiritual ritual—just pain finally spilling over. But after the crying stopped, I sat down cross‑legged on the floor of my home studio… and something unexpected happened:

My mind went quiet.  

Not peaceful.  
Not enlightened.  
Just quiet in a way I had never felt before.  

And in that silence, something inside me dissolved.  
My boundaries.  
My name.  
My story.  
All the little identities I held so tight.  

For a few moments, I felt like one being instead of a separate self.  
Like everything was connected in a way that was simple, obvious, almost embarrassingly clear.  

It felt like I understood the universe in a single night.  
Not intellectually—more like my mind finally unclenched enough to realize everything was made of the same pulse.  

The next day, the algorithm showed me a video explaining “ego death,” and I remember staring at my phone, realizing:

…that’s exactly what I went through.  

I wasn’t imagining it.  
I wasn’t crazy.  
I was just finally hearing the language for what my mind experienced.  

A few days later, I smoked a little weed, found meditation music, laid down, and the same deep void opened again. The same dissolving. The same sense of unity. I slipped into that wordless space like my body recognized the doorway now.  

And then—by coincidence or timing or vulnerability—I found this spiritual teacher online talking about food, the body, corruption, raw living. I was still open, still cracked from everything, and his words hit me like they were aimed straight at the rawest part of my soul.  

I remember sitting in a coffee shop, staring at my grocery bag, listening, feeling like he was confirming everything I had just gone through without knowing it. So I threw away the processed food, the junk, everything that didn’t feel “clean.” Not because of indoctrination—because in that moment, it felt like a continuation of the change happening inside me.  

And just like that, my whole life pivoted in under a week.  

Not because of magic.  
Not because I was chosen.  
But because my mind opened at the exact moment my heart cracked, and I stepped through the gap.  

That was my awakening.  
Raw.  
Messy.  
Unprepared.  
But real in the way it changed me forever.  

A story of a mind pushed open by chemicals, pain, and stillness… and a person who didn’t yet know the language for what they lived.
